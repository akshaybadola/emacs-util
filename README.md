# Some Emacs Utility Functions

These are some of my emacs utility functions which I use frequently. Since they
were being duplicated over some of my packages I decided to separate them. They
may be useful to others also.

## Disclaimer

I in no way claim originality to all of these functions, but I've written most
of these myself perhaps reinventing the wheel in some cases. I've given
citations wherever possible.
